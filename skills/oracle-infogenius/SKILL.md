# /oracle-infogenius - AI Architect Visual Generation

**Think Like an AI Architect. Visualize Like Oracle. Zero Typos.**

## Mission

Generate **enterprise-grade, technically-validated Oracle Cloud architecture visuals** that meet the standards of a Senior AI Architect. Every image must be:

- **Research-Grounded** - Validated against Oracle documentation via Google Search
- **Technically Accurate** - Correct service names, capabilities (26ai, Command A, Llama 4)
- **Brand-Compliant** - Official Oracle colors (#C74634), typography
- **Zero Text Errors** - Perfect spelling, grammar, no truncation
- **Presentation-Ready** - Professional quality for customer engagements

---

## Default Style: ISOMETRIC

**Isometric 3D is the ONLY recommended style** because:
- Clear layered structure with tier labels on left margin
- True 3D perspective adds depth without visual chaos
- Professional blueprint/technical documentation aesthetic
- Every component readable and properly positioned
- Flow lines show data movement logically
- Suitable for customer presentations AND technical documentation

Other styles available only if explicitly requested.

## Quick Start Pipeline

```
RESEARCH → ARCHITECT → COMPOSE → GENERATE → VALIDATE
```

### Step 1: RESEARCH (Always)
```javascript
WebSearch("OCI {service} features capabilities 2026")
```
Validate current service names before generating.

### Step 2: ARCHITECT
- **Audience**: C-Suite / IT Leadership / Technical
- **Style**: ISOMETRIC (default) | executive | technical
- **Layers**: 4 standard tiers

### Step 3: COMPOSE PROMPT (Include Text Quality Block)

**MANDATORY: Include this in EVERY prompt:**
```
TEXT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE):
- All text must be perfectly spelled with zero typos
- Use complete words only - NEVER truncate (e.g., "Optimizer" not "Optimizr")
- Professional English grammar throughout
- Technical terms must match official Oracle naming exactly
- Font must be clean, readable sans-serif, consistently sized
- Verify all service names against current Oracle documentation
- Double-check every label before rendering
```

Oracle Brand Colors:
- **Primary**: Oracle Red `#C74634`
- **AI/Agents**: Purple `#7B1FA2`
- **Security**: Green `#388E3C`
- **Data**: Orange `#F57C00`
- **Channels**: Blue `#1976D2`

### Step 4: GENERATE
```javascript
mcp__nanobanana__generate_image({
  prompt: "{constructed_prompt_with_text_quality_block}",
  aspect_ratio: "16:9",
  model_tier: "pro",
  enable_grounding: true,    // ALWAYS - validates facts AND text
  thinking_level: "high",
  resolution: "high",
  negative_prompt: "blurry text, typos, misspellings, truncated words, inconsistent fonts, grammar errors, pixelated text, amateur design, wrong technical names"
})
```

### Step 5: VALIDATE
Check BEFORE delivering:
- [ ] All text perfectly spelled (scan every word)
- [ ] All Oracle service names current and correct
- [ ] All model names match official naming
- [ ] Visual follows isometric style
- [ ] Grounding was enabled during generation
- [ ] Font clean and readable at presentation size

## Current Oracle Service Catalog (January 2026)

### Database
| Service | Correct Name | NEVER Use |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **Oracle AI Database 26ai** | AI Vector Search, HNSW, True Cache | 23ai, 23c |

### Generative AI
| Service | Correct Name | NEVER Use |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **OCI Generative AI** | Cohere Command A (256K context) | Command R, Command |
| **OCI Generative AI** | Meta Llama 4 Maverick | Llama 3, Llama 2 |
| **Agent Hub** | OCI Agent Hub (multi-agent orchestration) | just "Agent Hub" |
| **Embeddings** | Cohere Embed 4 | Embed v3 |

### Standard Architecture Layers
1. **DATA INGESTION LAYER** - Sources + OCI Streaming
2. **INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM** - Database + Storage + Cache
3. **AI ORCHESTRATION** - Agent Hub + Specialized Agents
4. **CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION** - Output channels

- Use complete words only - NEVER truncate (e.g., "Optimizer" not "Optimizr")
- Professional English grammar throughout
- Technical terms must match official Oracle naming exactly
- Font must be clean, readable sans-serif, consistently sized
- Double-check every label before rendering

VISUAL STYLE:
- True isometric 3D perspective (30-degree angles)
- Clean white/light gray background

- Orange (#F57C00) blocks for data sources
- "ORACLE" logo prominent at top
- Soft drop shadows on white background

ARCHITECTURE TIERS:
[Specify your 4-tier architecture here]

COMPOSITION:

- Connecting pipes/tubes showing data flow between tiers
- Clear readable labels on EVERY component
- Flow direction: top-to-bottom or left-to-right
```
